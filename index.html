          <p style= "margin-top:-10px;">Recently graduated from Queens College with a BS degree in Computer Science. My main area of focus during college was programming. I've worked with quite a few Object Oriented languages like Java and C++. During Highschool, I studied Computer Networking at Thomas Edison Vocational and Technical High School. I was able to obtain a CCNA certification during my time there, as well as an HP connected Devices certification.</p><p> I would also consider myself as a pretty experienced writer, thanks to my years as a student journalist in high school. Competitiveness and the urge to solve problems push me to be my very best. I'm always looking for something to work on and to be better than I was before.</p>

          <ul class = "Lists" style = "list-style-type:square; list-style-position:inside">
            <li><b>Sports</b> : As a Jets, Mets and Knicks fan I've experienced a lifetime of losing and failure. Nothing will phase me.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Video Games</b> : I like to play video games to experience the deep story and plot. Games have very much come a long way in the entertainment industry as some have better acting and deeper stories than some of Hollywood's finest.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>DC & Marvel</b> : Who doesn't love a good comicbook movie? Infinity War was definitely better than Endgame</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Books</b> :The Witcher saga by Andrzej Sapkowski are my favorite set of fictional books. I would definitely recommend checking it out, Netflix has already started an adaptation of the series.</li>
